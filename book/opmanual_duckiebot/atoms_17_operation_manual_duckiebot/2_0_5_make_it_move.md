# Making your Duckiebot move {#rc-control status=ready}

This page is for Duckiebots in `DB18` configuration. For previous year's instructions see [here](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT17/).

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: A Duckiebot in `DB18` configuration.

Requires: Laptop configured, according to [](#laptop-setup).

Requires: You have configured the Duckiebot as documented in [](#setup-duckiebot).

Results: You can make your robot move.

</div>


<!--Requires: You have created a Github account and configured public keys,
both for the laptop and for the Duckiebot. The procedure is documented in [](+software_reference#github-access).-->


## Option 1 - With the Duckietown Shell {#make-it-move_shell status=ready}

Assuming that your Duckiebot is [properly initialized](#setup-duckiebot), if you have a gamepad then plug the usb dongle into the raspberry pi and you should be able to move it with the joystick.

If you would like to move your robot using your laptop, you can run

    $ dts duckiebot keyboard_control ![DUCKIEBOT_NAME]

which, after startup should open the interface window that looks like the following,

<figure>
    <figcaption>The keyboard control graphical user interface</figcaption>
    <img style='width:8em' src="keyboard_gui.png"/>
</figure>

The following keys control the Duckiebot:

<col2 figure-id="tab:virtual_keyboard" figure-caption="Keyboard joystick functions" class="labels-row1">
    <span>Keys</span>
    <span>Function</span>
    <span>ARROW_KEYS</span>
    <span>Steer your Duckiebot</span>
    <span>q</span>
    <span>Quit</span>
    <span>a</span>
    <span>Turn on Lane Following</span>
    <span>s</span>
    <span>Stop Lane Following</span>
    <span>i</span>
    <span>Toggle Anti-instagram</span>
</col2>

If, for some reason, you cannot get the window to open, run the command with the `--cli` option to get a command line interface:

    laptop $ dts duckiebot keyboard_control ![hostname] --cli


Warning: This does not currently work on Mac OSX - need to fix



### Troubleshooting

Symptom: The robot doesn't move

Resolution: Check that the `duckiebot-interface` is running

Open [the Portainer interface](#docker-setup-portainer-interface) and check the running containers. You should see one called `dt18_03_roscore_duckiebot-interface_1`.

You call also determine this by running:

    $ docker -H ![DUCKIEBOT_NAME].local ps

and look at the output to find the Duckiebot interface container and verify that it is running.

Resolution: One of the base images is out of date

Pull the base images on the Duckiebot:

    $ docker -H ![DUCKIEBOT_NAME].local pull duckietown/dt-duckiebot-interface:devel20

and on the laptop:

    $ docker pull duckietown/rpi-duckiebot-base:master19-no-arm

TODO: Update the image above `duckietown/rpi-duckiebot-base:master19-no-arm`

## Option 2: Using the dashboard {#setup-ros-websocket-image status=beta}

If you followed the instructions in [](#duckiebot-dashboard-setup), you
should have access to the Duckiebot dashboard.

You can open the browser and visit the page `http://![hostname].local/mission-control`.

This is the Mission Control page.
It is the page that lets you monitor and control your Duckiebot.
The top of the page should be similar to the following image,


<div figure-id="fig:dashboard_mission_control_auto" figure-caption="">
  <img src="dashboard_mission_control_auto.png" style='width: 35em'/>
</div>


The first thing to check to make sure that everything we have done so far
is correct, is the status of the **Bridge**, in the top-right corner of the page.
The label should show the status "**Bridge: Connected**" (as shown in the image above).
If the indicator reads "**Bridge: Closed**", it means that something went wrong
while launching the ROS websocket node above. In that case, start again from
the beginning of this section.

Note: Don't worry if one of the blocks is called "Camera" but you
don't see an image. We will get to that later.

This page will show you lateral and angular speed of your robot, and
a plot of left and right motor speed. Toggle the **Take over** switch
in the top-right corner of the page to gain control of your robot.
You will see that the background of the page will highlight and the
central plot will start moving.

You can now use the arrows on your keyboard to drive your Duckiebot.

**Did you know?**
The page contains 4 blocks by default.
Feel free to drag them around and rearrange them as you please.
You can also use the menu button of each block to resize them.

<!--

## Option 2 - Docker + ROS {#make-it-move_docker_ros status=ready}

Run the base image on the duckiebot:


    laptop $ docker -H ![hostname].local run -it --net host --privileged --name base duckietown/rpi-duckiebot-base:master18 /bin/bash


Then when the container has started


    container $  roslaunch duckietown joystick.launch veh:=![hostname]


#### Controlling your robot with a joystick

You can now use your joystick to move things around


#### Controlling your robot with the keyboard

If you have cloned the repo on your laptop and installed ROS, then you can start the keyboard controller interface with


    laptop $ make virjoy-![hostname]


## Option 3 - Pure ROS {#make-it-move_ros status=deprecated}


#### Controlling your robot with a joystick

SSH into the Raspberry Pi and run the following from the `duckietown` directory:


    duckiebot $ cd ~/duckietown
    duckiebot $ source environment.sh


The `environment.sh` setups the ROS environment at the terminal (so you can use
commands like `rosrun` and `roslaunch`).


Now make sure the motor shield is connected.

Run the command:


    duckiebot $ make demo-joystick


If there is no "red" output in the command line then pushing the left joystick
knob controls throttle - right controls steering.

Close the program using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.



#### Controlling your robot with the keyboard

ssh into your robot and run:


    duckiebot $ make demo-joystick


Now on your laptop run:


    laptop $ make virjoy-![hostname]


Note: you need to have `pygame` installed, see the [README](https://github.com/duckietown/Software/tree/master18/misc/virtualJoy)

Note: not currently supported on Mac OSX



It is possible you will have to unplug and replug the joystick or just push lots of buttons on your joystick until it wakes up. Also make sure that the mode switch on the top of your joystick is set to "X", not "D".

XXX Is all of the above valid with the new joystick?



## Troubleshooting

Symptom: When do a `docker run` command you get a response like: `Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet`

Resolution: you need to set the date on your robot to something close to reality. This can be done in an automated fashion (e.g. `ntpdate` ) but a bulletproof way is to run:


    duckiebot $ date -s "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"



Symptom: The robot doesn't move when I use the joystick


Resolution: Check that the joystick receiver is in one of the USB port on the Raspberry Pi.

Resolution: Check that the joystick is detected by ssh'ing into the Duckiebot and running:

    duckiebot $ ls /dev/input/

and verify that  there is a device called `js0` on the list.

Resolution:  Test whether or not the joystick itself is working properly, run:

    duckiebot $ jstest /dev/input/js0

Move the joysticks and push the buttons. You should see the data displayed change
according to your actions.

Resolution: Check that the cables on your robot are connected



Symptom: The robot moves weirdly (e.g. forward instead of backward).

Resolution: The cables are not correctly inserted. Please refer to [the assembly guide](#assembling-duckiebot-db18) for pictures of the correct connections. Try swapping cables until you obtain the expected behavior.

Resolution: Check that the joystick has the switch set to the position "x". And the mode light should be off.

Symptom: The left joystick does not work.

Resolution: If the green light on the right to the "mode" button is on, click the "mode" button to turn the light off. The "mode" button toggles between left joystick or the cross on the left.

<!--

## The proper shutdown procedure for the Raspberry Pi

Generally speaking, you can terminate any `roslaunch` command with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.

To completely shutdown the robot, issue the following command:

    duckiebot $ sudo shutdown -h now

Then wait 30 seconds.

Warning: If you disconnect the power before shutting down properly using `shutdown`,
the system might get corrupted.

Then, disconnect the power cable, at the **battery end**.

As an alternative you can use the `poweroff` command:

    duckiebot $ sudo poweroff

Warning: If you disconnect frequently the cable at the Raspberry Pi's end, you might damage the port.

<!--

## Watch the program output using `rqt_console`

Also, you might have notice that the terminal where you launch the launch file
is not printing all the printouts like the previous example. This is one of
the limitation of remote launch.

Don't worry though, we can still see the printouts using `rqt_console`.

#### With Docker

On the laptop run:


    laptop $ dts start_gui_tools ![hostname]



#### With ROS

On the laptop, open a new terminal window, and run:


    laptop $ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://![hostname].local:11311/
    laptop $ rqt_console


Either way, You should see a nice interface listing all the printouts in real time,
completed with filters that can help you find that message you are looking for
in a sea of messages.
If `rqt_console` does not show any message, check out the *Troubleshooting* section below.

You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> at the terminal where `roslaunch` was executed to stop all the
nodes launched by the launch file.

See also: For more information about `rqt_console`, see [](+software_reference#rqt_console).

##### Troubleshooting

Symptom: `rqt_console` does not show any message.

Resolution: Open `rqt_console`. Go to the Setup window (top-right corner).
Change the "Rosout Topic" field from `/rosout_agg` to `/rosout`. Confirm.

Symptom: `roslaunch` fails with an error similar to the following:


    remote[![hostname].local-0]: failed to launch on ![hostname]:

    Unable to establish ssh connection to [![username]@![hostname].local:22]:
    Server u'![hostname].local' not found in known_hosts.


Resolution: You have not followed the instructions that told you to add the `HostKeyAlgorithms`
option. Delete `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and fix your configuration.

See: The procedure is documented in [](+software_reference#ssh-local-configuration).
